Welcome to the Pizza Delivery Web App project! This project is a web application built using Django, a powerful web framework for Python. The app allows users to place orders for delivery of pizzas from a local pizzeria.

Getting Started
To get started with the app, you will need to have Python and Django installed on your machine. You can check if you have Python installed by running the following command in your terminal:

python --version

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the Python website.

To install Django, run the following command:

pip install django

Next, clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Razwanul-Islam/PizzaBazar.git

Navigate to the project directory:


cd pizza-delivery-webapp

Run the following command to start the development server:


python manage.py runserver

The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Usage
To place an order, users can select a pizza from the menu and add it to their cart. They can then proceed to checkout, where they can enter their delivery information and pay for their order. The app also allows users to view their past orders and cancel any orders that have not yet been fulfilled.
